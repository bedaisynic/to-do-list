# HeadSpin Responsive Email Template

## MJML
MJML is a framework which helps to create responsive emails. It has the similar syntax like HTML. To start working on creating an email, you can download the [official desktop app](https://mjmlio.github.io/mjml-app/) to edit your email with live rendering or install [mjml](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=attilabuti.vscode-mjml) in your code editor.

## How to use the email template

This basic template is designed for HeadSpin standard email. It consists of the head, header, body, and footer. To create your email, you can simply link the head, header, and footer into your template and replace the body with your content.

The template can be used like this:

```html
<mjml>
 <mj-head>
   <mj-include path="./_head.mjml" />
   <mj-style>

       Your customized styling goes there

   </mj-style>
 </mj-head>
 <mj-body>
   <mj-wrapper>
    <mj-include path="./_header.mjml" />
     <mj-section>
       <mj-column>
         <mj-text>

          	Your main content goes there

         </mj-text>
       </mj-column>
     </mj-section>
   </mj-wrapper>
   <mj-include path="./_footer.mjml" />
 </mj-body>
</mjml>
```

## How to generate HTML file

After finishing creating the email, make sure to generate an HTML file, and use the same name as MJMLâ€™s and put it in the same folder. You can either generate it by the desktop app or export it from your IDE.

For example:
```html
your_template.mjml
your_template.html
```
